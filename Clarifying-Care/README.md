# Clarifying-Care
Clarifying Care aims to improves hospital efficiency and patient outcomes through the use of new innovative tools. We are focused on improving the current discharge summary creation and communication.
After a hospital visit in the US, you can expect to be provided with a discharge summary, which is a report detailing events of your stay and further care that needs to be taken. Discharge summaries can be confusing for patients to read and understand. They also take up precious hospital time to create.
